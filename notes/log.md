# Log

## What and Why
I believe great projects have "housekeeping" items that are included within them.  One of those items is a log.  This log provides insight into the progress, struggles, and random thoughts from the creator as the project develops over time.

Yes, I'm using ChatGPT to help do some heavy lifting.  I added a notes from aid file within the notes' directory.  I want to capture how working on an application with AI has helped.  I'm not really sure how much or how little it will.  Perhaps it's a crutch.  I know a lot of people are going to think that it is.  Especially if I call myself a "solo" dev.  However, I don't think that makes sens.  If you call up a peer for help and suggestions, asking the right questions and determining for yourself if the answers provided are worth implementing.  We haven't gotten to the point where AI is building fully complex applications. Even if it were, I think people might complain... but it will be those who use it first to make bank-breaking businesses that will be employed.

### 2023 11 05 | Start
Project started.  I currently only have a concept in mind.  Create an application of a dungeon management system that works like a hotel management system.  I know it's a terrible idea to start a project without a better discussion on its purpose, design and scope.  For instance, I could see myself tacking on a budget system, mapping system, employee HR system and so much more.  As such, I need to first think of Dungeon Management Master (DMM) as primarily focused on managing a dungeon with rooms, employees (monsters), managers (bosses), owners (big bosses), customers (adventures), rewards (loot), and amenities (traps).  Most of these things will have subsets, but I shouldn't go deeper than one or two for each.  I will want to write a "purpose" page when I figure out what I want the user to experience when using the application.  In truth, I feel like this project is going to have a ton of writing compared with the code that is used to build it.
