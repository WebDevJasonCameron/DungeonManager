# Notes from AI

## What and Why
I believe conversations with AI using LLM can help expedite the creative process.  I spend a lot of mental time trying to figure out creative ideas, only to run dry or get burnt out when it comes time to needing that mental "juice" to figuring out how I want to build my code.  As such, I find it rewarding to ask someone for their ideas.  I don't really have a lot of people around me.  As such I use ChatGPT.  This Markdown document contains the conversations I've had.

Me:
> This works very well.  I also know hotels often have events like business conferences or weddings.  How could we incorporate event management into this dungeon management application?  Do you have any ideas?

Gpt:
> Incorporating event management into your dungeon management application is a creative way to add variety and new dimensions to the gameplay. Here are some ideas on how you can achieve this:

> Event Types: Introduce different event types that can take place within the dungeon. For example:

> 1. Tournaments: Organize combat tournaments where adventurers compete against each other or face off against monsters. 
> - Treasure Hunts: Create special events where adventurers can participate in treasure hunts with unique rewards. 
> - Festivals: Host in-game festivals, complete with games, challenges, and special vendors selling unique items. 
> - Event Scheduling: Allow dungeon managers to schedule events at specific times or dates. This can create anticipation and excitement for players.
> 2. Event Marketing: Implement marketing and advertising features within the application. Dungeon managers can promote their events to attract adventurers. 
> 3. Participant Registration: Allow adventurers to register for events, either individually or as teams. This can be managed by the application. 
> 4. Event Rewards: Design special rewards and prizes for event participants. These rewards can include rare items, in-game currency, or unique titles or achievements. 
> 5. Event Challenges: Create custom challenges and encounters for events. For instance, during a tournament, adventurers might face off against waves of monsters or solve puzzles to advance. 
> 6. Leaderboards: Track and display leaderboards for events, allowing participants to compete for the top spot. 
> 7. Event Income and Expenses: Track the financial aspects of events, including costs for organizing the event, as well as revenue generated from entry fees or other sources.
> 8. Event Feedback: Gather feedback from participants after events to improve future events and overall dungeon management. 
> 9. Event History: Maintain a history of past events, which can be viewed by adventurers and used for reference in event planning. 
> 10. Role-Playing Opportunities: Incorporate role-playing elements in events, such as NPCs and unique storyline interactions. 
> 11. Incorporate Special Event Spaces: Designate specific areas within the dungeon for hosting events, with the ability to customize these spaces for different occasions. 
> 12. Event Calendar: Implement an in-game calendar that shows upcoming events and their details.

> By introducing event management features, you can encourage player engagement and add a layer of dynamic storytelling to your DungeonMaster application. Events can serve as a fantastic way to break the routine of dungeon exploration and provide additional challenges and opportunities for adventurers and dungeon managers alike.

> This feature can also be monetized, as you can charge entry fees or offer premium event packages to generate in-game revenue, further enhancing the financial aspects of dungeon management.

Me: 
> Hello.  Good evening.  I am creating a fun application that manages game dungeons.  It works a lot like a hotel management application.   It manages the type of dungeon like a hotel manages its star rating.  I manages its dungeo rooms as if they were hotel rooms.   The monsters  are like a hotel staff while adventures are like the hotel customers.  There are a lot of other things that are managed within the dungeon in relation to a hotel.  Can you provide an intro page to what I'm talking about?  I want to use it for a Read Me file in my GitHub repository.
