Dungeon Manager is a game dungeon management application that combines the principles of hotel management with the fantasy elements of tabletop role-playing games (RPGs). It offers you the tools to:

3. Hire Monsters: In Dungeon Manager, monsters serve as your loyal staff, guarding the dungeon and challenging adventurers. Customize their roles and abilities to keep the guests entertained.

4. Welcome Adventurers: Adventures are your guests. They explore your dungeon, complete quests, and seek rewards. Provide them with a memorable and challenging experience, just like a hotel caters to its customers.

5. Track Bookings and Resources: Manage bookings and resources efficiently, ensuring that your dungeon is always ready for new adventurers.
